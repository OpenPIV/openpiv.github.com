title: Pressure from PIV released
published_date: Jul 6, 2013
---

We released our improved and documented version of OpenPIV-pressure package. It was used
in 1999 in the (probably the first open source, to the best of our knowledge) paper on 
extracting pressure from the PIV data, using Poisson equation. See the Github page:
<http://www.openpiv.net/openpiv-pressure> for details.
