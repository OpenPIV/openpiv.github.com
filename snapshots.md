### C++ with Qt-based GUI 

<img src="images/8930832_orig.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" width=600px>

very fast algorithm, used for the long-duration, time-resolved PIV analysis of the 
dynamic flutter in turbulent flows. Analysing 10,000 image pairs can become an issue 
when the PIV analysis takes 1 minute per image pair.
