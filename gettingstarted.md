### How do we help our users

We typically answer very quickly on our mailing list. Users that have difficulty to read images or process it, send e-mails like this one: 

	`Dear Sir/Madam,

	I am not being able to load images at all. Everytime I try to load an image tif/bmp/etc... I hear a error sound on my mac and thats it.
	Any advice?`


We usually suggest to have a Dropbox or FTP with a bunch of images (in this particular case it was very helpful to see more than just a first pair, because there is no motion in the first pair). 

We got a Dropbox share and the question about our Matlab GUI-based version. So instead of writing back, we shot this screenshot and send back to the user. **On the way to the next satisfied OpenPIV user :)**
