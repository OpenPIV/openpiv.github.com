title: OpenPIV has released the POD toolbox
---


POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) Toolbox is our most recent release. This is a special post-processing analysis method for PIV, PTV and numerical data. The toolbox
was developed back in 2000 as an objective method to identify, extract and characterize the coherent structures in the turbulent 
boundary layers. It has been used since to reveal the underlying structure in jets, wakes, mixing layers, bird flight and fish swimming experiments. 
It has been successfully applied to the DNS and LES data. See the publications of Roi Gurka, Alex Liberzon and others for the references. 


POD is another name for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), see Wikipedia for the details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis
