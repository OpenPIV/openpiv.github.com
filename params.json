{"name":"OpenPIV - open source Particle Image Velocimetry","body":"### Welcome to OpenPIV project\r\n \r\n**OpenPIV** is an initiative of scientists to develop a software, algorithms and methods for the state-of-the-art experimental tool of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) which are free, open source, and easy to operate.\r\n\r\nOpenPIV is the successor of the well known URAPIV software - it is faster, more friendly and much more flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpenPIV is provided using Matlab, Python and C++ with Qt frontend.\r\n\r\nOpenPIV is not anymore \"just\" an open source PIV analysis of images. It is a fully integrated solution \"from images to the publication\". We provide an integrated **Matlab toolbox for Spatial and Temporal PIV data analysis**","google":"","tagline":"open source particle image velocimetry, openpiv, openpiv, piv, free, piv","note":"Don't delete this file!
