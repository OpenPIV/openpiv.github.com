### Dynamic masking method for OpenPIV-Python is ready

It is a rather simple method using a sort of background illumination removal idea, with a bit of tweaking for the dynamic masking of the moving bodies. 


See it in Ipython Notebook viewer. This method has not been included in the OpenPIV yet, since it has to be tested first.
