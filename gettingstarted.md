### Using the OpenPIV out-of-the-box on the online Wakari environment


No installation is required. Just use this link - open a new account on Wakari.io and you'll have the tutorial in your browser using IPython notebook, based on Numpy/SciPy/Matplotlib/ and our OpenPIV library. 

<https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/openpiv/openpiv-python_tutorial>



### Download and install locally

If the online solution on Wakari is not convenient, download the software using the <http://www.openpiv.net/downloads.html> or using the source code cloning from Github.


### Getting started screencasts and tutorials

1. Matlab - see the screencast http://youtu.be/yg-LjAt-v3Q or read the tutorial by <a href="mailto:Sergio.Bengoechea.Lozano@tnt.TU-Berlin.DE"> Sergio Bengoechea Lozano, TU Berlin </a>
[[https://github.com/OpenPIV/openpiv.github.com/wiki/Tutorial_OpenPIV.pdf]]
2. Python - <http://www.openpiv.net/openpiv-python/>
3. C++ - not ready yet
4. Spatial and Temporal Analysis Toolbox <http://www.openpiv.net/openpiv-spatial-analysis-toolbox/>


### Support and documentation
How to get support? Where to ask questions? Use one of the following:
1. Use our mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/openpiv-users
2. E-mail to [openpiv2008@gmail.com](openpiv2008@gmail.com)
3. Comment on the Github repository or open an issue on Github, for instance https://github.com/OpenPIV/openpiv-python/issues


### How do we help our users

We typically answer very quickly on our mailing list. Users that have difficulty to read images or process it, send e-mails like this one: 

	`Dear Sir/Madam,

	I am not being able to load images at all. Everytime I try to load an image tif/bmp/etc... I hear a error sound on my mac and thats it.
	Any advice?`


We usually suggest to have a Dropbox or FTP with a bunch of images (in this particular case it was very helpful to see more than just a first pair, because there is no motion in the first pair). 

We got a Dropbox share and the question about our Matlab GUI-based version. So instead of writing back, we shot this screenshot and send back to the user. **On the way to the next satisfied OpenPIV user :)**
