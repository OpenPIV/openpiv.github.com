title: How to udpate the website
---

The website <http://www.openpiv.net> is actually the <http://openpiv.github.io>. The website is built thanks to Jekyll, Github pages and Bootstrap. 

1. In order to add a new page, add a file `newpage.md` to the repository by forking, adding and sending pull request. 
2. In order to report an issue, send us a comment to [openpiv-users@googlegroups.com](mailto:openpiv-users@googlegroups.com) or open an issue on Github.
3. To add a new post, simply add a file named `year-month-day-title-of-the-post.md` to the folder _posts. Again this is possible after obtaining the developer permissions to the original repository <http://github.com/openpiv/openpiv.github.com> or forking and sending a patch or a pull request. It takes precisely 30 seconds.
